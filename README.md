You can call me my in-game name or lena, idm! I'm not sure how to code but ill eventually figure its out so for the time being I'll write about myself here. 

I go by she/her and prefer that but I dont mind if you use different pronouns. *Check all my links to get more info!*

Personality: Infj-t - This is a part of the mbti. "What does it mean?" Introverted, Intuitive, and deep thinkers who are turbulent advocates, and tend to be more laid back with a tight circle of friends.

I have a lot of interests, but my main fixations right now are supernatural, grey's anatomy, breaking bad, my little pony, the boys, vintage physical media, music, fleetwood mac, rock, skincare, marvel, dc, art, martial arts, and plenty of others!
