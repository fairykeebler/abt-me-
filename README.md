You can call me my in-game name or lena, idm! I'm not sure how to code but ill eventually figure it out so for the time being I'll write about myself here. 

I go by she/her and prefer that but I dont mind if you use different pronouns. *Check all my links to get more info!*

🎂: Dec 22 

Personality: Infj-t - This is a part of the mbti. "What does it mean?" Introverted, Intuitive, and deep thinkers who are turbulent advocates, and tend to be more laid back with a tight circle of friends.

I have a lot of interests, but my main fixations right now are supernatural, grey's anatomy, the long walk, breaking bad, my little pony, the boys, vintage physical media, music, fleetwood mac, weezer, medicine, rock, skincare, marvel, dc, art, martial arts, dance, and plenty of others!

At times I may distance myself *Also just apart of my mbti and how I am* so please do not take it to heart and instead give me some space. (just in general not in game)

Boundaries

- If I'm playing pony town, feel free to interact! Interact in the sense means cuddle & hug, talk or whatever, just dont be weird towards me!

- Please try not to trauma dump on me all the time, I feel like you should talk to someone you know in person or someone you are close with instead of a random.

- Do not take it personally if I dont friend you, I rarely request or accept.

That's all for now!! c:
